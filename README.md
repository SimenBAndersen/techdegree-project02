This is the second of in total 12 projects that I will be doing through Treehouse's Fullstack Javascript Techdegree. 

Technology used:
- jQuery

In this project:
- Started out as a webpage showing a long list of 54 students, all on the same page. 
- My task was initially to divide the students into groups of 10 and show each group on a seperate page. 
- Page buttons has been added on the bottom of the screen for easier navigation
(Page button is not shown when only one page of students is available)
- In addition: I have added a search bar/function that lets the user search for a student information. i.e. name or email.
- The search filters out students that does not match the user input and creates new pages based on the matching students
(Prints a message if no students match the users search)
